Original source code for the Christmas game I was part of in December 2000.

I'm actually really proud of this one. The game is really fun which is due to "TM"'s level design and overall game idea. The overall feel of the game is also really what we wanted in our games all along.
Sadly this release also marked our departure from DOS and towards Windows, and eventually 3D.

The source code is only partly recovered, and I hope to soon locate the complete set of files. However, the gameplay code is there. This is the same code I've used to port the game to Game Boy Advance during the last many years :) Let's see when I finish that.

Disclaimer: By publishing this I also kinda reveal that I was behind the handle "AM" in the team "TMB Productions". It's funny to read my old readme files now. Remember: These were written by a 14-17 year old with plenty of humour, only that humour isn't really clear in texts :)


Overall: Gameplay coded in QuickBasic 4.5, all graphics, input, etc. in x86 assembler (files missing).

P.BAS -> QuickBasic Game Source file 1/2
P2.BAS -> QuickBasic Game Source file 2/2
P.MAP -> Leftover from a compilation
M.BAS -> QuickBasic Map editor. The same map editor we used for most of our 2D games.

Funny note: The files are named using single letters since that took less time to write in the DOS command line :)


Remember: Have fun, and "QB forever"! :)
